WP template?

We should probly use either Wordpress or Squarespace.
I'm leaning towards WP


SITE FEATURES:

HOME: Basic summary/image
NOTEABLE CASES: list of cases. include results
PUBLICATIONS: List of published works. Links to some?
PRACTICE AREAS: What he does
CONTACT: just contact info.

Really no need for so-called 'advanced' features, like blogging, etc

$8.25/mo wp, $16/mo SS

Logo? I don't LOVE the logo, but something like it should work (also, its 'Newman AND Associates').

2* "understanding federal sentencing". Which location was when?!


strongly suggest read thru of case summaries, as some of them seem rather... wishy washy. would suggest removal || specifying of vaguer ones.
