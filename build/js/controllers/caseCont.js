    $scope.caseBlurbs = ["His very first federal jury trial, that of a man charged with hiding his two nephews who had escaped from Virginia's death row, resulted in a not guilty verdict (Johnnie Lee Council). In his first homicide case, he was able to convince the government's attorney that his client was a victim, and not the shooter, by having a bullet removed from his client's shoulder, which came from the shooter's gun, and was not a close-fired shot.", "Mr. Newman has successfully litigated appeals, which reversed the death sentences of Perry Poole, Michael LaCava (police killing), and Billy Brooks. He retried all three cases with successful results. None of these men returned to death row. He also represented one of two brothers charged in the most highly investigated police killing in Philadelphia history, preventing a death penalty. He has tried other murder cases to a not guilty (Darnell Murphy, Alex Hague), and even had a murder case discharged at a preliminary hearing on the grounds of self-defense.", "Mr. Newman successfully prevented an adult trial of a Long Island juvenile football player charged with the extreme hazing, including charges of sodomy, of younger football players while at a training camp in the Poconos. The youth was sent to a boot camp for several months.", "He represented the head of the Delaware Valley Pagans, who received a short sentence (27 months), for a daylight shooting in South Philadelphia, witnessed by over a dozen law enforcement agents, including the FBI.", "Mr. Newman tried the case of the owner of an ambulance company charged with taking diverted calls from a 911 dispatcher, gaining the dismissal of all felony charges.", "He successfully prevented the federal prosecution of the head of an alleged telemarketing scheme involving over $100 million.", "Mr. Newman represented a Berks County District Judge charged with obstruction of justice and destruction of evidence. A week-long jury trial resulted in a complete acquittal.", "Mr. Newman has represented a number of police officers. He was successful in having the harsh sentence of John Baird (initially represented by another attorney), the leader of the '39th District' police gang, reduced from 13 years to time-served.", "He recently convinced prosecutors not to charge a man with murder, who had fired his gun in self-defense.", "Just as notably, some of Mr. Newman’s successes are cases in which, after vigorous pre-charge representation, no charges were filed against his clients. For example, Mr. Newman has represented students at the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Pennsylvania State University, and Lehigh University who were falsely accused of rape. Mr. Newman has recently successfully convinced the U. S. Justice Department to not charge an attorney in a multi-million dollar Medicare fraud case."]
        //RE: "not to charge a man with murder who had fired his gun in self defense"... is this a bit vague? Yes, attorney client priviledge is a thing, but I almost feel this is going too far in the other direction. A little sort of "oh yeh, he, uh, wins stuff..."
